      <h2>About Dementia</h2>
      <p>Dementia is a term for several diseases that affect memory, thinking, and the ability to perform daily activities.

        The illness gets worse over time. It mainly affects older people but not all people will get it as they age.<br></p>
        <p>Dementia is a syndrome that can be caused by a number of diseases which over time destroy nerve cells and damage the brain, typically leading to deterioration in cognitive function (i.e. the ability to process thought) beyond what might be expected from the usual consequences of biological ageing. While consciousness is not affected, the impairment in cognitive function is commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by changes in mood, emotional control, behaviour, or motivation.</p>
        <p>Dementia has physical, psychological, social and economic impacts, not only for people living with dementia, but also for their carers, families and society at large. There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatization and barriers to diagnosis and care.</p>
    <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
    <p>Diagnosing dementia involves a comprehensive medical evaluation, including medical history, physical examination, cognitive tests, and brain imaging. Although there is no cure for most types of dementia, early diagnosis and intervention can help manage symptoms, slow down the progression of the disease, and improve quality of life.</p>
    <p>Treatment may include medications to manage symptoms such as memory loss and behavioral changes, as well as therapy, support services, and lifestyle modifications.</p>
    <h2>Treatment and care</h2>
    <p>There is no cure for dementia, but a lot can be done to support both people living with the illness and those who care for them.</p>
    <p>People with dementia can take steps to maintain their quality of life and promote their well-being by: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>being physically active</li> 
        <li>taking part in activities and social interactions that stimulate the brain and maintain daily function.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, some medications can help manage dementia symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil are used to treat Alzheimer disease.</li>
<li>NMDA receptor antagonists like memantine are used for severe Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia.</li>
<li>Medicines to control blood pressure and cholesterol can prevent additional damage to the brain due to vascular dementia.</li>
<li>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help with severe symptoms of depression in people living with dementia if lifestyle and social changes don’t work, but  these should not be the first option.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If people living with dementia are at risk of hurting themselves or others, medicines like haloperidol and risperidone can help, but these should never be used as the first treatment.</p>
    <h2>Self-care</h2>
    <p>For those diagnosed with dementia, there are things that can help manage symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stay physically active.</li>
<li>Eat healthily.</li>
<li>Stop smoking and drinking alcohol.</li>
<li>Get regular check-ups with your doctor.</li>
<li>Write down everyday tasks and appointments to help you remember important things.</li>
<li>Keep up your hobbies and do things that you enjoy.</li>
<li>Try new ways to keep your mind active.</li>
<li>Spend time with friends and family and engage in community life.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Plan ahead of time. Over time, it may be harder to make important decisions for yourself or your finances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify people you trust to support you in making decisions and help you communicate your choices.</li>
<li>Create an advance plan to tell people what your choices and preferences are for care and support.</li>
<li>Bring your ID with your address and emergency contacts when leaving the house.</li>
<li>Reach out to family and friends for help.</li>
<li>Talk to people you know about how they can help you.</li>
<li>Join a local support group.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is important to recognize that providing care and support for a person living with dementia can be challenging, impacting the carer’s own health and well-being. As someone supporting a person living with dementia, reach out to family members, friends, and professionals for help. Take regular breaks and look after yourself. Try stress management techniques such as mindfulness-based exercises and seek professional help and guidance if needed.</p>
    <h2>Risk factors and prevention</h2>
    <p>Although age is the strongest known risk factor for dementia, it is not an inevitable consequence of biological ageing. Further, dementia does not exclusively affect older people – young onset dementia (defined as the onset of symptoms before the age of 65 years) accounts for up to 9% of cases. Studies show that people can reduce their risk of cognitive decline and dementia by being physically active, not smoking, avoiding harmful use of alcohol, controlling their weight, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining healthy blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Additional risk factors include depression, social isolation, low educational attainment, cognitive inactivity and air pollution.</p>
    <h2>Safety Precautions</h2>
    <h3>Our Dementia Care Team Strives to Ensure the Safety of Your Loved One</h3>
    <p>It is important that people with memory-impairing illnesses, such as dementia, feel safe and secure in their environment. In-home caregivers can create this stability and comfort by doing a few simple things in advance or on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>Since people with dementia often have the desire to wander—both inside and outside.</p>
        
        <h4>Many of these safety tips are designed to keep the person from tripping and falling as well as from leaving the house undetected:</h4>

        <ul>
        <li>Remove any furniture that the person might trip over, including footstools, magazine racks, and coffee tables. However, once these changes have been made, make it a point to not rearrange furniture as it might cause confusion.</li>
        <li>Place a hidden key somewhere outside as people with dementia can misplace their own keys and inadvertently lock out an in-home caregiver.</li>
        <li>Place a gate at the top and bottom of staircases and make sure it is not so short that it can tripped over. Stairs can be very dangerous for people with dementia, particularly the entrance and exit, so consider adding some sort of color contrast to the top or bottom step with paint or color strips.</li>
        <li>Place locks out of the normal line of vision on doors—either higher or lower than usual.</li>
        <li>Outdoor areas should be fenced in and bodies of water should be fenced off.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to these physical home care resources, we are also aware that sometimes just talking can help a person with dementia. Topics that evoke feelings of safety a mother, a home can be reassuring</p>
        <p>Implementing precautions for dementia is paramount in providing a supportive and safe environment for individuals affected by the condition. By following these precautions diligently, caregivers can enhance the quality of life for dementia patients and reduce the risk of accidents or worsening symptoms. Remember, each individual may have unique needs and challenges, so it's essential to adapt these precautions to suit specific circumstances and consult healthcare professionals for personalized guidance.</p>
        <p>Together, with proactive measures, education, and support, we can create a more dementia-friendly society, fostering understanding, empathy, and inclusivity for those living with dementia and their caregivers. Let's work towards a world where everyone affected by dementia can lead fulfilling and dignified lives.</p>
