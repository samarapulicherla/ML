    <h2>Key facts</h2>
    <p>Currently more than 55 million people have dementia worldwide, over 60% of whom live in low-and middle-income countries. Every year, there are nearly 10 million new cases.</p>
    <p>Dementia results from a variety of diseases and injuries that affect the brain. Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to 60–70% of cases.</p>
    <p>Dementia is currently the seventh leading cause of death and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally.</p>
    <p>In 2019, dementia cost economies globally 1.3 trillion US dollars, approximately 50% of these costs are attributable to care provided by informal carers (e.g. family members and close friends), who provide on average 5 hours of care and supervision per day.</p>
    <p>Women are disproportionately affected by dementia, both directly and indirectly. Women experience higher disability-adjusted life years and mortality due to dementia, but also provide 70% of care hours for people living with dementia.</p>
    <h2>About Dementia</h2>
    <p>Dementia is a term for several diseases that affect memory, thinking, and the ability to perform daily activities.

        The illness gets worse over time. It mainly affects older people but not all people will get it as they age.<br></p>
        <p>Dementia is a syndrome that can be caused by a number of diseases which over time destroy nerve cells and damage the brain, typically leading to deterioration in cognitive function (i.e. the ability to process thought) beyond what might be expected from the usual consequences of biological ageing. While consciousness is not affected, the impairment in cognitive function is commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by changes in mood, emotional control, behaviour, or motivation.</p>
        <p>Dementia has physical, psychological, social and economic impacts, not only for people living with dementia, but also for their carers, families and society at large. There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatization and barriers to diagnosis and care.</p>
    <h2>Types of Dementia</h2>
    <p>There are several types of dementia, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Alzheimer's Disease:</strong> The most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of cases. It is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain.</li>
        <li><strong>Vascular Dementia:</strong> Caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, often due to strokes or small vessel disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Lewy Body Dementia:</strong> Characterized by the presence of abnormal protein deposits in the brain called Lewy bodies, leading to fluctuating cognitive symptoms.</li>
        <li><strong>Frontotemporal Dementia:</strong> A group of disorders characterized by degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, resulting in changes in behavior and personality.</li>
        <li><strong>Mixed Dementia:</strong> When a person has more than one type of dementia simultaneously, such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
    <p>Several factors may increase the risk of developing dementia, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Family history of dementia</li>
        <li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
        <li>High blood pressure</li>
        <li>Diabetes</li>
        <li>Smoking</li>
        <li>Obesity</li>
        <li>Lack of physical activity</li>
        <li>Brain injuries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>
    <p>Changes in mood and behaviour sometimes happen even before memory problems occur. Symptoms get worse over time. Eventually, most people with dementia will need others to help with daily activities.</p>
    <p>Early signs and symptoms are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>forgetting things or recent events</li>
        <li>losing or misplacing things</li>
        <li>getting lost when walking or driving</li>
        <li>being confused, even in familiar places</li>
        <li>losing track of time</li>
        <li>difficulties solving problems or making decisions</li> 
        <li>problems following conversations or trouble finding words</li> 
        <li>difficulties performing familiar tasks</li>
        <li>misjudging distances to objects visually.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Common changes in mood and behaviour include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>feeling anxious, sad, or angry about memory loss</li> 
        <li>personality changes</li>
        <li>inappropriate behaviour</li>
        <li>withdrawal from work or social activities</li>
        <li>being less interested in other people’s emotions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dementia affects each person in a different way, depending upon the underlying causes, other health conditions and the person’s cognitive functioning before becoming ill.</p>
    <p>Most symptoms become worse over time, while others might disappear or only occur in the later stages of dementia. As the disease progresses, the need for help with personal care increases. People with dementia may not be able to recognize family members or friends, develop difficulties moving around, lose control over their bladder and bowls, have trouble eating and drinking and experience behaviour changes such as aggression that are distressing to the person with dementia as well as those around them.</p>
    <h2>Common forms of dementia</h2>
    <p>Dementia is caused by many different diseases or injuries that directly and indirectly damage the brain. Alzheimer disease is the most common form and may contribute to 60–70% of cases. Other forms include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (abnormal deposits of protein inside nerve cells), and a group of diseases that contribute to frontotemporal dementia (degeneration of the frontal lobe of the brain). Dementia may also develop after a stroke or in the context of certain infections such as HIV, as a result of harmful use of alcohol, repetitive physical injuries to the brain (known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy) or nutritional deficiencies. The boundaries between different forms of dementia are indistinct and mixed forms often co-exist.</p>
    
    <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
    <p>Diagnosing dementia involves a comprehensive medical evaluation, including medical history, physical examination, cognitive tests, and brain imaging. Although there is no cure for most types of dementia, early diagnosis and intervention can help manage symptoms, slow down the progression of the disease, and improve quality of life.</p>
    <p>Treatment may include medications to manage symptoms such as memory loss and behavioral changes, as well as therapy, support services, and lifestyle modifications.</p>
