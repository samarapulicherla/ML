Developed a predictive model for dementia using the xgboost algorithm, achieving high accuracy rates in identifying individuals at risk of developing the condition.
Leveraged machine learning techniques to analyse large datasets of clinical and demographic information, identifying key risk factors and patterns associated with dementia onset.
Implemented feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the xgboost model's performance, enabling early detection and intervention strategies for individuals susceptible to dementia
